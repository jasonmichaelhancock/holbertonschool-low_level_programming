This project introduces algorithms and the "Big O" concept.  It onclides discussion of the following topics:

1) At least four different sorting algorithms; 
2) What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm;
3) How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input; and
4) What is a stable sorting algorithm.
